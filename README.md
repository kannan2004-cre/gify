# gify
website that users can can use to search and download gifs
I have used giphy api for gif search 
You can just enter keyword which you think is related to your specific gif and hit enter. It displays all the relevant gifs associated to the keyword and you can download it directly from the website itself
HTML and CSS is used for structing the page and javascript is used for implementing functionality.
If you think this needs any further improvements or has any bugs or issues feel free to contact @parthivm2004@gmail.com
